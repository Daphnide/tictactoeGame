Hello! I'm Daphnide. :)

After recently completing my spring semester and learning C in my Computer Science I class, I am hooked!

I wanted to challenge myself by trying to incorporate a lot of the concepts that I had learned from the course which included: printing, scanning, data types (int, float, char), characters and string character arrays, functions, conditional formatting (if/else), switches, loops (for, while, do-while), etc..

So I thought it would interesting to try and create a tic tac toe game....

Challenges:

I had to focus on how I was going to print the grid inside of a character string array and think about how I was goig to position the X's and Diamonds.
It was a bit tricky to get the X's and Diamonds to print because I ended up spliting the X's and D's into the top half and the bottom half and having to iterate through the grid at a specific position in order to ensure both parts of the play aligned on the grid
I also needed to find a way to take into account all of the end-user input and execute their play on the grid and then output the grid with the play so it was clear what was entered by the user
Another challege I faced was trying to keep track of all of the possible ways a tic tac toe could occur on the grid and set up conditional formatting for each scenario and correctly 

I hope you enjoy my tic tac toe game! :)
